# Chart-Analyezer

My problem:

I gues the data is being readed from the MySQL table, and if i run the program there is a plot showing up the price candles and the volume, only the rsi isn't showing up and there is a extra Price chart showing up.

Question:
How do i show the values of the RSI and how do i delete the last price chart?
